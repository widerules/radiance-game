## Intro ##
_**Radiance**_ is still under development. It is written in java and uses _AndEngine_ for the graphics platform.  It started as an educational Java/Android project, so except for the graphics platform, most of the code is built from scratch. The inspiration for the development of this game came from various turn-based tactics-RP games, but most notably the "Shining Force" series for SEGA Game-Gear (If you haven't seen it, you can find a windows emulator + ROM in [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/radiance-game/downloads/detail?name=Fusion364%2BSFG.rar) (risk-free. Alternatively you can Google it on your own))

_Radiance_ is aimed to be easily modable, so most game-specific information is not hard-coded, but instead stored in human-readable configuration files (such as items, sprites, effects, etc). Theoretically, without changing the code, a medieval-fantasy game could be rebuilt into a hi-tech setting. Moreover, it should, with minimal code editing, be convertible to any kind turn-based tactics game.
